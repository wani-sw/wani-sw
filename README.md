- 👋 Hi, I’m @wani-sw
- 👀 I’m interested in IT infrastructure, coding and networking
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the fundamentals of IT by actively applying concepts to labs
- 💞️ I’m hoping to learn how to build projects that matter, and be able to understand what needs work

Don't really know how to use GitHub yet, but looking to learn. 

There always seems to be more and more to learn, and the more I learn the less I seem to know.
